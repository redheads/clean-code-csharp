## SOLID

- SRP: Single Responsibility <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- OCP: Open/Close <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- LSP: Liskov Substitution <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- ISP: Interface Segregation <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- DIP: Dependency Inversion <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

### Single Responsibility Principle

> A class should have only one reason to change

Robert C. Martin

---

### Open/Close Principle

> Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

Bertran Meyer / Robert C. Martin

---

### Liskov Substitution Principle

> Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

Barbara Liskov

---

### Interface Segregation Principle

> Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

Robert C. Martin

---

### Dependency Inversion Principle

> Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
